Contains the <code>Action</code>s used by the GUI in menus and other places.

<br><br>

The actions are stored by the {@link net.sf.freecol.client.gui.action.ActionManager} and
are all subclasses of {@link net.sf.freecol.client.gui.action.FreeColAction}.

<p>If you implement a new action, you must also add a corresponding
line to the {@link
net.sf.freecol.client.gui.action.ActionManager#initializeActions()}
method. Each action is identified by a short ID, such as
"quitAction". In order to provide localization, you must also add a
line to the localization file
"data/strings/FreeColMessages.properties" using the ID of the action
plus ".name" as key.

<p>You can also add a line with the ID of the action plus ".accelerator"
in order to define a key binding. The value of the accelerator must be
unique and must be valid Java KeyStroke Strings, as described
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/swing/KeyStroke.html#getKeyStroke%28java.lang.String%29">here</a>.
