/* How this is supposed to work:
 *
 * Assuming the AIPlayer has a set of goals...
 * At the start of a turn, it will call
 *
 *    setNeedsPlanningRecursive(true);
 *
 * for all its goals. This will set all goals in a state of needing a check.
 * After that, it will iterate through its goals in a WHILE-loop:
 *
 *    boolean furtherPlanning = true;
 *    while (furtherPlanning) {
 *        FOR ALL GOALS g DO {
 *            g.doPlanning();
 *        }
 *
 *        SATISFY_UNIT_REQUESTS();
 *        HANDLE_REMAINING_REQUESTS();
 *
 *        furtherPlanning = false;
 *        FOR ALL GOALS g DO {
 *            furtherPlanning = (furtherPlanning || g.needsPlanning());
 *        }
 *    }
 *
 * The first FOR-loop will recursively reach all existing goals and plan()
 * each of them once, bottom-up.
 *
 * After that, unit requests from the goals will have piled up.
 * SATISFY_UNIT_REQUESTS() will try to satisfy as many as possible,
 * in order of importance, by using the units that were created between turns
 * or that have been given back by other goals.
 *
 * HANDLE_REMAINING_REQUESTS() will try to do something about remaining requests,
 * for example by buying/building new units, setting up new goals etc.
 *
 * This, as well as goals called later during this process moving a unit to a former goal,
 * may have set one or more of the goals to needsPlanning=true. In the second FOR-loop,
 * we check whether this is the case, to eventually repeat the process.
 *
 * Eventually, the WHILE-loop will exit. Any units in the goals will have
 * been used for this turn. There may still be some excess units that haven't been
 * requested by any Goal. The AIPlayer may now choose to create a new Goal for these,
 * add them to an existing Goal (which will make use of them next turn),
 * or just keep them unused to have something to deal out next turn.
